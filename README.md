This project represents some of the ways we use Golang at [Sust Global](https://www.sustglobal.com/).
Specifically, the modules herein provide some core reusable components that underpin our microservice architecture, enabling us to focus on our growing climate data platform.

Feel free to use the code here yourself under the Apache 2.0 open source license.
We would love any comments/feedback here via GitHub issues/PRs. 
You can also get in touch on social @sustglobal.
